Find out who uses src/frontc/cprint (pretty printing is done in ocamlutils/pretty).

Make sure you can't have obliv pointers

Not sure what the parser currently does in the following line, but I need the 'obliv' applied to the int, and not the whole array.
  obliv int x[5];
Also check this on typedefs

floating point and enum types
check obliv array length (variable) in decl
special case: disallow/warn obliv variables in printf
warn if 'obliv if' has non-obliv condition

TODO list as of 3/6 (George leaves for Japan)

(1) Make malloc() and friends (calloc(), etc.) get a new node at each
    callsite. See markprt.ml. 
(2) Make a file with global declarations of common functions like strcpy().
    These declarations should include pointer annotations and should be
    used instead of the ones that appear in the source.
(3) Add support for multiple files and separate compilation. Idea: store
    the preprocessed source and the compiler flags in a fake .o file. Wait
    until the linking step (when all of the .o files are available at once)
    to actually compile, make the graph, infer the types, and so on.
(4) Create a more complete example of boxing and inference (e.g.,
    hashtest).
(5) Actually implement some simple constraint solver to infer annotations.
(6) Modify the boxing code to use the constraint-solver results.
(7) Have some way to handle memory management (i.e., write a garbage
    collector).
(8) Handle variable argument functions.
(9) Find some way to describe [recursive] types at runtime and use them as
    tags. 
(10) Consider collapsing A->B->C constraints to A->C if there are no other
    nodes that touch B. 

 - casting of function pointers is problematic. For each cast a wrapper should
   be written instead! 

 - functions with pointer return type but missing returns are a safety
   problem.

 - uninintialized local variables are a problem.

 - vararg functions are a problem. By definition, they involve taking the
   address of a formal argument. BOX sees this and and makes a copy of that
   argument. But also there is no easy way to do bounds checking for vararg.

 - BOX copies formals whose address is taken into a local. But it forgets to
   copy them back upon return. This should not be a problem because in most
   C compilers the caller cannot see the effects on the actual arguments.

 - We must turn on alignment on a 32-bit boundary. Otherwise, MSVC pads the
   tagged structures (sometimes) and puts an extra word between the length and
   the data. The padding is fixed for now in safeccheck.h

 - Writing or reading unaligned pointers is not allowed. 

 - Right now when we try to read a pointer and we don't find one in tags, we
   overwrite the base part of the pointer to be read with 0. But this might
   have undesired side-effects.

 - handle gcc's __PRETTY_FUNCTION__

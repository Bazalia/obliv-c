 - casting of function pointers is problematic. For each cast a wrapper should
   be written instead! 

 - functions with pointer return type but missing returns are a safety
   problem.

 - uninintialized local variables are a problem.

 - vararg functions are a problem. By definition, they involve taking the
   address of a formal argument. BOX sees this and and makes a copy of that
   argument. But also there is no easy way to do bounds checking for vararg.
